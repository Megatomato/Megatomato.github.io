# Experimenting with Docker Containers 
As a developer, I had heard about Docker containers for years but never found the time to dive in. When a recent assignment required me to use Docker, I had an  opportunity to explore this technology.

## Getting Started with Docker
My first step was installing Docker Desktop on my machine. The setup process was surprisingly straightforward, and within minutes I had the Docker engine running. Docker Desktop is a neat gui that requires little setup, whether I am working off of my mac computer or running them through wsl on a windows machine (despite my general dislike of the wsl subsystem). 

Although I didn't create any new containers, the assignment required me to load up some different dev containers. What amazed me was the ease with which the containers loaded in, and how I had a full linux machine ready to go.

However, if you are not physically present at a computer, this can create some issues. For some unknown reasons, when docker desktop restarts your computer during installation, it breaks the remote desktop capability of the computer on the university network. That was a bit annoying. 

## The Benefits I Discovered
What impressed me most was how Docker solved the "it works on my machine" problem. The containers ran identically across different environments. I also appreciated:

- The clean separation between my host system and development environments
- How easy it was to switch between containers
- The ability to experiment without fear of breaking my local setup
